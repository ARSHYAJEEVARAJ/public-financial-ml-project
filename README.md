# Analysis and Classification of Public UPI Transaction Data Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project analyzes public UPI transaction data using machine learning techniques.
A Random Forest classifier is used to identify transaction patterns and evaluate model performance.

## Dataset
Public UPI transaction data (RBI / Kaggle public dataset).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Random Forest model training
5. Prediction and evaluation

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Results
The model achieved good classification performance on public financial transaction data.
